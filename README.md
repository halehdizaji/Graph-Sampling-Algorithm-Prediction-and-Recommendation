# Graph Sampling Quality Prediction for Algorithm Recommendation


This repository includes the code and data for the **Graph Sampling Quality Prediction for Algorithm Recommendation** paper, a method for predicting quality and performance of different graph sampling algorithms of three categories (node-based, edge-based and traversal).

This tutorial includes instructions for graph data preparation, processing, sampling, model training and evaluation, providing model reproducibility. It consists of following sections:
1. Data generation
2. Graph feature extraction
3. Graph sampling and evaluation
4. Mutual information analysis
5. Feature selection and preparation
6. Data analysis
7. Model training
8. Model testing
9. Result analysis
10. ML explainability
